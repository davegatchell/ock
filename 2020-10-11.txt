Here is a link to 26 songs. I tried to incorporate Psych, Pop, Punk and Soundtrack to each song. Still work in progress but I think they are pretty good so far. Lots of Dave drums, piano, shaker, random objects. 

Some songs are pretty 'poppy' which is fine by me, my only goal is to make music for nice headphones played back kinda loudly that I want to hear, focusing on being almost a drug, tapping into the 'sounds' that trigger that magic drug like journey. Weird but enjoyable... That's the plan anyways :)

I've not worked vocals much besides the Flavor Crystals stuff so i guess we can just try and give it a shot. I am definitely wanting vocals, not an afterthought, was the plan so hopefully it works out great.

Totally open to ideas, etc. I can provide various weird lyrics stuff I tried to write but anything goes that works.

I think combinations of slow calm vocals and faster erratic vocals might be cool but I don't really know what it will sound like, hard to imagine. 

If Sonoko is up for giving it a try that is super coolio! If there are any expenses etc, let me know I can reimburse for sure.
